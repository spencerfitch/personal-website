Hello world! My name is Spencer and I’m an aspiring software engineer. I would describe myself as a full-stack engineer with a slight preference for the back-end aspect. I have enjoyed working on a large range of topics, but particularly enjoy the challenge and beauty that comes with piecing the components of an API and application architecture together like a puzzle. 

I was born and raised in rural Wisconsin, which has played a large role in shaping how I approach programming and problem solving in general. Much of my childhood and summers were spent tagging along with my dad, an independent general contractor, from job-site to job-site working on various tasks. Over the years, I’ve done everything from building patios to cutting down trees. In doing so, I learned how to quickly analyze unique situations and rapidly problem solve  to find potential solutions. So while I may have no formal work experience, my unique upbringing has provided me with years of practical problem solving experience that I utilize every day in programming.

In my free time, I enjoy doing anything and everything related to being outside. If I’m not busy working, you’ll likely find me hiking through the woods, biking on a trail, or swimming in a lake. I also enjoy taking photos, watching sports, and listening to a wide range of music.
