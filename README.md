# Personal Portfolio Website

![Website Logo](/docs/hero.png)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website [spencerfitch.com](https://www.spencerfitch.com). 

I built the website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a robust front-end JavaScript framework built upon React and GraphQL. Prior to building this website, I had heard about the advantages of Gatsby, mainly its fast pre-rendered pages, but had never actually used the framework myself. Over the course of roughly a week, I was able to both learn how to use Gatsby and utilize it to build a clean and fast personal portfolio. The website utilizes GraphQL queries heavily in order to dynamically populate the website using data stored in MDX documents. This way, I am able to freely update the content of the portfolio website without ever having to touch the React source code that builds and controls the website. 

In order to style the website, I utilized locally scoped CSS modules, another new technology for me in this project. Using these, I was able to create a unique, versatile style for my website that scales well to any screen size. I also utilized some bootstrap components, mainly the Navbar and display font sizes, in order to simplfiy the implementation of those components.
